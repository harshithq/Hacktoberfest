First Joke : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three friends, stranded on a desert island, find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish.
The first friend wishes he was off the island and back home. 
The second friend wishes the same. 
The third friend says "I'm lonely. I wish my friends were back here."

Second Joke :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack and John met by chance on the street. 
After chatting for some time, Jack said to the John, "I'm extremely sorry, but I've forgotten your name. You'll need to tell me." 
The John stared at Jack thoughtfully for a long time, then replied, "How soon do you need to know?"
